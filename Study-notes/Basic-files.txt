Index.js : 

Does 4 main things : 

1. Imports required tools
2. Creates the router
3. Connects react to the DOM
4. Starts rendering the app

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
=>ReactDOM is responsible for rendering react into the browser
=> /client gives access to modern React features

"import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";" 
=> Used to measure performance 


import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromElements,
  Route,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router-dom";

=>createBrowserRouter --- Creates a router using browser URL
=>Route	--- Defines a route
=>createRoutesFromElements --- Converts JSX routes to config
=>RouterProvider --- Makes router available to app

=> createBrowserRouter creates a router based on browser history, while createRoutesFromElements converts JSX Route components into route configuration.
